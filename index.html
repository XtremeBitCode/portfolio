                <p>Apart from programming, I enjoy watching practically all sports, but my personal favorite is football. Since 2005, when I saw Gerrard smash the winner to qualify for the UEFA Champions League round of 16, I've been a Liverpool FC supporter. A big salute to Formula One. Visiting cool places on occasion, whether it's restaurants, museums, nightclubs, the karibas and vic falls, and so on.
